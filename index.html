          <h4>According to a review article by Paul Kingsbury, a cultural geographer who has 
            studied crop circles extensively, there are several characteristics of crop circle 
            formations that have been observed or reported by researchers. Some of these 
            characteristics are:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Crop circles are usually found in cereal crops such as wheat, barley, or 
              canola, but they can also appear in other crops such as corn, soybean, 
              rapeseed, or sunflower.</li>
            <li>Crop circles can vary in size from a few meters to hundreds of meters in 
              diameter. The largest crop circle ever recorded was 800 meters long and 350 
              meters wide in Milk Hill, England in 2001.</li>
            <li>Crop circles can have simple or complex designs, ranging from circles to 
              ellipses to polygons to fractals to pictograms. Some crop circles have multiple 
              layers or elements that form intricate patterns or symbols.</li>
            <li>Crop circles can appear overnight or during the day, but they are usually 
              discovered in the morning by farmers or aerial observers. Some crop circles 
              have been witnessed being formed by mysterious lights or sounds in the sky.</li>
            <li>Crop circles are not randomly distributed across the landscape but tend to 
              cluster near roads, population centers, or cultural heritage sites such as 
              Stonehenge or Avebury. Nearly half of all crop circles found in the UK in 
              2003 were located within a 15 kilometers radius of the Avebury stone circles.</li>
          </ul>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <h2 class="chapter-title2">Chapter 5</h2>
          <h4>We can tell the difference between fake &amp; authentic.</h4>
          <p>Cerealogy is the study of crop circles. Pictures and descriptions of crop 
            circles world-wide, particularly in England. Starting in England (?) in 
            17th century, ramping up since the 1970's; pictograms, geometry and formations.</p>
          <p>According to the NY Times all (or even most) of the
            Crop Circles WORLDWIDE were made by TWO people!</p>
          <h4>Stating these two made perfect concentric crop circles and pictograms, 
            sometimes over an acre in size. And they've done this now for over 40 years.
            Never mind they're both dead now. And, they made over 84,000 crop circles/pictograms
            all over the World. Sometimes 5 or 6 in one night on different sides of the globe.
            This, according to the WA Post &amp; NY Times.
            These two organizations are moronic idiots.
            Either they are the dumbest shits who ever lived.
            OR they are on the take.</h4>
          <p>NOBODY is that stupid. Nobody!...
            You 2 make me sick.  Communism is no worse than
            YOU &amp; your lies!
            And what about UAP's?  You know, UFO's?
            They won't even report on them.
            1,000's of sightings Worldwide every
            month. Over 500,000 documented since 1947.
            That is a true scientific mystery.
            Wouldn't even know it if you trust
            either of these 'news'papers or 99.9% of the scientists in this World.</p>

  <h1>Here are some ways to make accountability journalism better so people will actually read it</h1>

LINK: www.americanpressinstitute.org  ➚   |   Posted by: Christine Schmidt   |   August 8, 2017

Legos, quizzes, and tweetstorms: these are some of the tools and presentations of facts that the <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/">American Press Institute</a> highlights as exemplary uses by leaders in accountability journalism, in the API’s latest report on “how to make the best of journalism better for audiences.”

The 58-page report examines how accountability journalism — which it defines as “work that encompasses fact-checking, explanatory and investigative reporting, but more generally applies to the journalistic work of holding the powerful accountable” — can be realigned to provide better context for audiences and have a better shot at finding a solid reception from readers. The authors of the report — <a href="https://twitter.com/janeeliz?lang=en">Jane Elizabeth</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lorikelley22">Lori Kelley</a>, and <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/viscom/faculty/">Julie M. Elman</a> — say journalism right now has the opportunity to go deeper and farther than just explainers: “You might call it the recording of information in a more accessible manner: emphasizing the non-narrative, data, or visual elements made possible by digital news. By whatever name, the key goal is to offer a more accessible path for audiences to understand and accept new information, especially when it involves civic affairs and public debate.”

The report includes a portfolio of examples in this recoded accountability journalism notion, such as the <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2016/features/howard-frankland-bridge-plan-legos/how-we-did-it/">Tampa Bay Times’ Lego project</a> laying out a controversial transportation plan, political messaging app <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/07/purple-the-news-startup-built-around-sms-is-leaving-it-behind-for-facebook-messenger/%3EPurple%3C/a%3E%20providing%20context%20to%20political%20news%20over%20Facebook%20Messenger%20and%20SMS,%20the%20%3Ca%20href=">Baltimore Sun’s interactive tour and quizzes</a> to go through the details of an investigation into local housing courts, and <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/04/with-its-new-no-bullshit-tone-on-social-propublica-is-meeting-realdonaldtrump-where-he-lives/">ProPublica’s edited tweetstorms</a> that aim to counter misinformation as it happens. The API report goes in-depth with leaders of each explainer’s effort and also shares advice for other newsrooms to implement them.

With its new, “no-bullshit” tone on social, ProPublica is meeting @realDonaldTrump where he lives
April 12, 2017
The report includes a portfolio of examples in this recoded accountability journalism notion, such as the <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2016/features/howard-frankland-bridge-plan-legos/how-we-did-it/">Tampa Bay Times’ Lego project</a> laying out a controversial transportation plan, political messaging app <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/07/purple-the-news-startup-built-around-sms-is-leaving-it-behind-for-facebook-messenger/%3EPurple%3C/a%3E%20providing%20context%20to%20political%20news%20over%20Facebook%20Messenger%20and%20SMS,%20the%20%3Ca%20href=">Baltimore Sun’s interactive tour and quizzes</a> to go through the details of an investigation into local housing courts, and <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/04/with-its-new-no-bullshit-tone-on-social-propublica-is-meeting-realdonaldtrump-where-he-lives/">ProPublica’s edited tweetstorms</a> that aim to counter misinformation as it happens. The API report goes in-depth with leaders of each explainer’s effort and also shares advice for other newsrooms to implement them.
Elizabeth, Kelley, and Elman also include target areas in the journalism process to “recode” and recommendations from experts for how to make that happen. Here are some condensed snippets:

1. Your audience.
How well do you know your audience? Do you know what they understand, don’t understand and would like to know more about? ‘If someone gave me $10 million to study explainer journalism,’ says [New York University professor <a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu">Jay] Rosen</a>, ‘the first thing I would do is to engage in a massive act of listening.’ This ‘big listen’ needs to encompass issues and questions that aren’t typically asked, Rosen says. For instance, asking the usual ‘What are the important issues in this election?’ is not the same as ‘What would you like the candidates to be discussing now?’ says Rosen…

2. Data and visualization
[Cognitive neuroscience expert <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/tali_sharot">Tali] Sharot</a> for one argues that, in teaching and learning, ‘Figures are better than text. They’re easier to process, they’re quicker to process, they grab our attention.’ And charts made from that data can have more impact on readers, research indicates…Try to find reliable data that supports a point on which most people can agree. For instance: ‘That project will cost us a lot of money’…

3. Storytelling and facts
Using facts and data is important especially in controversial or complex stories, but as <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/otm/">On The Media</a> host <a href="https://twitter.com/otmbrooke?lang=en">Brooke Gladstone</a> said on a recent show, context is just as essential. ‘Make sure that those facts can fit into the lives of people who don’t agree with you,’ said Gladstone. ‘In other words, you have to place them in a context, you have to explain their relevance and then you have to wait’ for indications of understanding….

4. Emotion and impact
<a href="https://twitter.com/jakehalpern?lang=en">Jake Halpern</a>, an author of the fully reported graphic narrative, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/syrian-refugee-family-welcome-america%3E%E2%80%9CWelcome%20to%20the%20New%20World,%E2%80%9D%3C/a%3E%20says%20in%20a%20recent%20American%20Press%20Institute%20interview%20that%20the%20strengths%20of%20strip-style%20visuals%20%E2%80%98are%20these%20quiet%20visual%20moments%20that%20speak%20more%20than%20words%20could.%E2%80%99%20Cartoon%20illustrations%20don%E2%80%99t%20need%20to%20be%20strip-style%20or%20completely%20developed%20to%20be%20effective,%20however.%20%3Ca%20href=">Mohit Mamoria</a> recently explained the complexities of Blockchain using computer-generated characters and simple drawings.

As artists and designers know, even typography can signify certain emotions. Writer and designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminhersh/">Ben Hersh</a> recently <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/05/how-fonts-are-fueling-the-culture-wars/">looked at the messages</a> sent by particular typefaces and warned: ‘Typography can silently influence…and it can do this as powerfully as the words it depicts’…

5. Words matter
Projects that effectively present complex topics are often short on words, focusing instead on visuals. When a presentation isn’t ‘overwhelmed with large amounts of text and you are more willing to invest the time to read the information…before you know it, you have consumed the entire story and you’re surprised you have done so,’ says [Atlanta-based visual journalist Rick] Crotts…https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-crotts-3927061/

6. Designing for shareability
Besides ensuring that the project looks good and works properly on social media platforms, Sharot notes that framing information in a positive or solutions-oriented manner will encourage more sharing.

‘People are more likely to share a positive message than a negative message’ — human nature, really, because positive messages reflect positively on the sharer, she said.
