The 58-page report examines how accountability journalism — which it defines as “work that encompasses fact-checking, explanatory and investigative reporting, but more generally applies to the journalistic work of holding the powerful accountable” — can be realigned to provide better context for audiences and have a better shot at finding a solid reception from readers. The authors of the report — <a href="https://twitter.com/janeeliz?lang=en">Jane Elizabeth</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lorikelley22">Lori Kelley</a>, and <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/viscom/faculty/">Julie M. Elman</a> — say journalism right now has the opportunity to go deeper and farther than just explainers: “You might call it the recording of information in a more accessible manner: emphasizing the non-narrative, data, or visual elements made possible by digital news. By whatever name, the key goal is to offer a more accessible path for audiences to understand and accept new information, especially when it involves civic affairs and public debate.”

The report includes a portfolio of examples in this recoded accountability journalism notion, such as the <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2016/features/howard-frankland-bridge-plan-legos/how-we-did-it/">Tampa Bay Times’ Lego project</a> laying out a controversial transportation plan, political messaging app <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/07/purple-the-news-startup-built-around-sms-is-leaving-it-behind-for-facebook-messenger/%3EPurple%3C/a%3E%20providing%20context%20to%20political%20news%20over%20Facebook%20Messenger%20and%20SMS,%20the%20%3Ca%20href=">Baltimore Sun’s interactive tour and quizzes</a> to go through the details of an investigation into local housing courts, and <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/04/with-its-new-no-bullshit-tone-on-social-propublica-is-meeting-realdonaldtrump-where-he-lives/">ProPublica’s edited tweetstorms</a> that aim to counter misinformation as it happens. The API report goes in-depth with leaders of each explainer’s effort and also shares advice for other newsrooms to implement them.

With its new, “no-bullshit” tone on social, ProPublica is meeting @realDonaldTrump where he lives

April 12, 2017

The report includes a portfolio of examples in this recoded accountability journalism notion, such as the <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2016/features/howard-frankland-bridge-plan-legos/how-we-did-it/">Tampa Bay Times’ Lego project</a> laying out a controversial transportation plan, political messaging app <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/07/purple-the-news-startup-built-around-sms-is-leaving-it-behind-for-facebook-messenger/%3EPurple%3C/a%3E%20providing%20context%20to%20political%20news%20over%20Facebook%20Messenger%20and%20SMS,%20the%20%3Ca%20href=">Baltimore Sun’s interactive tour and quizzes</a> to go through the details of an investigation into local housing courts, and <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/04/with-its-new-no-bullshit-tone-on-social-propublica-is-meeting-realdonaldtrump-where-he-lives/">ProPublica’s edited tweetstorms</a> that aim to counter misinformation as it happens. The API report goes in-depth with leaders of each explainer’s effort and also shares advice for other newsrooms to implement them.
Elizabeth, Kelley, and Elman also include target areas in the journalism process to “recode” and recommendations from experts for how to make that happen. 

Here are some condensed snippets:

1. Your audience.
How well do you know your audience? Do you know what they understand, don’t understand and would like to know more about? ‘If someone gave me $10 million to study explainer journalism,’ says [New York University professor <a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu">Jay] Rosen</a>, ‘the first thing I would do is to engage in a massive act of listening.’ This ‘big listen’ needs to encompass issues and questions that aren’t typically asked, Rosen says. For instance, asking the usual ‘What are the important issues in this election?’ is not the same as ‘What would you like the candidates to be discussing now?’ says Rosen…

2. Data and visualization
[Cognitive neuroscience expert <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/tali_sharot">Tali] Sharot</a> for one argues that, in teaching and learning, ‘Figures are better than text. They’re easier to process, they’re quicker to process, they grab our attention.’ And charts made from that data can have more impact on readers, research indicates…Try to find reliable data that supports a point on which most people can agree. For instance: ‘That project will cost us a lot of money’…

3. Storytelling and facts
Using facts and data is important especially in controversial or complex stories, but as <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/otm/">On The Media</a> host <a href="https://twitter.com/otmbrooke?lang=en">Brooke Gladstone</a> said on a recent show, context is just as essential. ‘Make sure that those facts can fit into the lives of people who don’t agree with you,’ said Gladstone. ‘In other words, you have to place them in a context, you have to explain their relevance and then you have to wait’ for indications of understanding….

4. Emotion and impact
<a href="https://twitter.com/jakehalpern?lang=en">Jake Halpern</a>, an author of the fully reported graphic narrative, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/series/syrian-refugee-family-welcome-america%3E%E2%80%9CWelcome%20to%20the%20New%20World,%E2%80%9D%3C/a%3E%20says%20in%20a%20recent%20American%20Press%20Institute%20interview%20that%20the%20strengths%20of%20strip-style%20visuals%20%E2%80%98are%20these%20quiet%20visual%20moments%20that%20speak%20more%20than%20words%20could.%E2%80%99%20Cartoon%20illustrations%20don%E2%80%99t%20need%20to%20be%20strip-style%20or%20completely%20developed%20to%20be%20effective,%20however.%20%3Ca%20href=">Mohit Mamoria</a> recently explained the complexities of Blockchain using computer-generated characters and simple drawings.

As artists and designers know, even typography can signify certain emotions. Writer and designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminhersh/">Ben Hersh</a> recently <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/05/how-fonts-are-fueling-the-culture-wars/">looked at the messages</a> sent by particular typefaces and warned: ‘Typography can silently influence…and it can do this as powerfully as the words it depicts’…

5. Words matter
Projects that effectively present complex topics are often short on words, focusing instead on visuals. When a presentation isn’t ‘overwhelmed with large amounts of text and you are more willing to invest the time to read the information…before you know it, you have consumed the entire story and you’re surprised you have done so,’ says [Atlanta-based visual journalist Rick] Crotts…https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-crotts-3927061/

6. Designing for shareability
Besides ensuring that the project looks good and works properly on social media platforms, Sharot notes that framing information in a positive or solutions-oriented manner will encourage more sharing.

<p>‘People are more likely to share a positive message than a negative message’ — human nature, really, because positive messages reflect positively on the sharer, she said.</p>

          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <h2>7 characteristics of effective accountability journalists</h2>
          <p>No matter what topics they cover, many journalists hold people and institutions responsible 
            for their words and actions. This “accountability journalism,” whether it is political fact-
            checking, investigations or other forms of reporting, must still engage readers and impact 
            audiences to be effective. All journalism, in the end, should strive to make the significant 
            interesting.</p>
          </p>Through its Accountability Journalism Program, the American Press Institute is trying 
            to help journalists do that. One step we’ve taken is to identify the shared characteristics 
            and processes of some of the most effective accountability reporters in the country. These 
            include journalists who cover politics, investigations, education, sports, culture and society.</p>
          <p>So what is “accountability journalism”? And what do we mean by “effective”?</p>
          <p>A comprehensive definition of accountability journalism is provided in the recent 
            book, “The News Media: What Everyone Should Know” by C.W. Anderson, Leonard Downie 
            and Michael Schudson:</p>
          <blockquote>
            “Accountability journalism encompasses traditional investigative reporting, but much more. 
            It includes fact-checking political speech, digging into digital data, and aggressive beat 
            coverage to reveal as much as possible about what is really going on in every aspect of 
            American society – from national security, government, politics, business and finance to 
            the environment, education, health, social welfare, sports, and the media industry itself.”
          </blockquote>
          <p>And how do we identify effective accountability reporters? These are journalists who 
            excel at reaching broad audiences with great impact, and are successful in communicating 
            meaning and context in their stories. Their work is closely read and widely shared, and 
            often has the power to change minds and policies.</p>
          <p>These journalists are naturally immersed in successful, 21st-century journalism. They 
            know they must understand and adapt to the needs and rhythms of different communities 
            to be relevant.</p>
          <p>[pulldata context=”The 7 characteristics of great accountability journalists: An 
            @AmPress report” align=right]</p>
          <p>Recently, we gathered 17 such reporters for two days in Washington, with the goal 
            of identifying techniques and models that can be shared to help journalists everywhere 
            make reporting on government and civic affairs more effective. Our working sessions 
            were designed to unearth what these 17 reporters are doing that’s successful and to 
            build teachable models from it.  Our draft report then was reviewed by experts.</p>
          <p>In those sessions, we gathered some early ideas and information that will help inform 
            our ongoing study. Looking at the specific characteristics of these highly impactful 
            journalists and their work, we see a pattern. From listening to them, we have identified 
            at least seven characteristics they have in common (listed in this report in no particular 
            order). These journalists:</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Exhibit broad curiosity; eagerly adapt to new technologies and platforms.</li>
            <li>Think about multiple audiences.</li>
            <li>Work hard to create context for their audiences.</li>
            <li>Smartly balance their time on story choices and audience interactions.</li>
            <li>Spend considerable time building relationships with sources, readers.</li>
            <li>Build connections and teamwork within their own newsrooms.</li>
            <li>Find their own way and direct their own work.</li>
          </ol>
